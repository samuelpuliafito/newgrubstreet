Used books

**Rhino Booksellers**, Nashville - _Recommended_

McKay's is the 800-pound gorilla in retail used books in North Carolina and Tennessee.

**McKay's**, Nashville

A bargain basement warehouse situated right off the highway. I hate it. I love it. 

New books

**Parnassus Books**, Nashville

A disorganized used bookstore with limited turnover and the obligatory musty and humid basement. Not without its charms or occasional finds. The Eclectible Shop has wide selections in art, religion, cooking, political science, and regional history. Its fiction selection leaves much to be desired.
