**Parnassus Books**, Nashville

A bookstore that rests on its independent laurels and the much-publicized ownership interest of Ann Patchett. The selection harbors no risk-taking at all. Its conservative streak is most apparent in its non-fiction, which features the political memoir of the week and sad paeans to land conservation written by sad sack C-list journalists. So miserably bland, it makes Barnes & Noble look like Shakespeare & Co. The bookstore that Nashville (writ suburban) deserves.

**The Bookshop**, Nashville

This is the postage stamp-sized bookstore that East Nashville deserves. Its diminutive size is

A disorganized used bookstore with limited turnover and the obligatory musty and humid basement. Not without its charms or occasional finds. The Eclectible Shop has wide selections in art, religion, cooking, political science, and regional history. Its fiction selection leaves much to be desired.
