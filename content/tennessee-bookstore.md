**Bagatelle Books**, Asheville - _Highest recommendation_

Bagatelle is the spiritual successor to Chan Gordon's Captain's Bookshelf, which was one of the best used bookstores in the region for more than 40 years. Captain's was a beautiful retail store, suffused with excellent, cozy lighting and a surfeit of literary fiction, history, regional interest, and rare and hard-to-find titles (e.g., first edition of _The Sound and the Fury_ for $15,000).

Bagatelle, which opened in 2019, is

**Downtown Books and News**, Asheville

Infrequent and changeable hours, check before you go.

**Malaprops Bookstore**, Asheville - New bookstore with cafe.

**Mr. K's Bookstore**, Asheville

Much like the similar-sounding regional chain of used bookstores-cum-pawn shops McKays, Mr. K's is a highly efficient bookbuying and selling operation in a brightly lit, cavernous strip mall location. Unlike McKays, Mr. K's is staffed by more discerning buyers. As a result, the selection is superior, albeit slightly smaller, than McKay's.

**Firestorm Books & Coffee**, Asheville

#### Middle Tennessee

Used books

**Rhino Booksellers**, Nashville - _Recommended_

McKay's is the 800-pound gorilla in retail used books in North Carolina and Tennessee.

**McKay's**, Nashville

A bargain basement warehouse situated right off the highway. I hate it. I love it. 

New books

**Parnassus Books**, Nashville

A bookstore that rests on its independent laurels and the much-publicized ownership interest of Ann Patchett. The selection harbors no risk-taking at all. Its conservative streak is most apparent in its non-fiction, which features the political memoir of the week and sad paeans to land conservation written by sad sack C-list journalists. So miserably bland, it makes Barnes & Noble look like Shakespeare & Co. 

**The Bookshop**, Nashville

This is the postage stamp-sized bookstore that East Nashville deserves. Its diminutive size is 

A disorganized used bookstore with limited turnover and the obligatory musty and humid basement. Not without its charms or occasional finds. The Eclectible Shop has wide selections in art, religion, cooking, political science, and regional history. Its fiction selection leaves much to be desired.

**Bookmarks NC**, Winston-Salem

Bookmarks organized a yearly literary festival in the Camel City before opening in its low-ceilinged, industrial space in 2017. The selection has only improved as time has gone by, featuring a decent snapshot of literary and genre fiction of the LitHub persuasion. It has several  although it lacks the adventuruousness that you might expect from a bookstore that is underwritten in large part by private donations.

The bookstore shares its space with Footnotes, a cafe run by Foothills Brewing.

**Piedmont Books**, Winston-Salem

A bargain basement McKays. Skip.

**Sunrise Books**, High Point

Intimate (read small) new bookstore in High Point.

**Glenwood Community Bookshop**,

**Scuppernong Books**,

**McKays,** Greensboro

**Pages Past**, Greensboro

An eminently skippable bookstore near the University of North Carolina-Greensboro. The store conflates old with interesting.
