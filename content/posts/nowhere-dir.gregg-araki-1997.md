A kandy-kolored, day-in-the-life group portrait of teenagers in 90s Los Angeles, centered around their copious drug use and sex---and the corresponding consequences that harsh their mellow. Namely, paranoia, rape, murder, and suicide. The sick sense of humor, intense nineties-ness of it all, and killer tunes tie it all together. Some stilted framing and bargain basement sets do make it feel oddly stiff.
