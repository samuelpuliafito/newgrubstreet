_The Hole_ is a short, intense vignette of an attempt to smuggle drugs into a prison. The book uses its experimental elements well: the unbroken paragraph of text conveys the crushing focus and desperation of the novel's protagonists; its persistent and unusual metaphors underscore the dehumanizing and brutalizing nature of the prison; and its mixture of violent and sexual language demonstrate the interplay of violence and sexual exploitation at work in the narrative.
